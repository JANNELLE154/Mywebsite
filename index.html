<p>I am a digital native with a determination to work in social media and digital marketing. 

Digital communication is second nature to me. In my Sixth Form, I was appointed head media perfect where I helped in media classes for different years introducing students to different media platforms from the business world, for example, social media platforms and how to use it to promote their product. I was soon asked to become head of the schoolâ€™s social media team with responsibility for editing their Facebook page. 

Since leaving school I regularly write blog posts on WordPress; take photos with my DLR camera and use Photoshop. I am an experienced editor of videography, sonography and film and have used platforms such as Salesforce. I have had a series of roles where I have used my social media and IT skills. As an ambassador for Fitzrovia Youth in Action (FYA) I develop case studies, and promote them through social media; at Jobscience I interact with customers through Live chat and email and at David Miller architects I used a high tech professional architecture device as part of my research.</p>
