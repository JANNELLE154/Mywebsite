<h1> Interest </h1>


 



<p>I also love to write blog posts for different events I attend like WE day and TED X teen to inspire other young people to attend these events. This has helped me develop my persuasive writing techniques and to interact with people from different backgrounds which suits my outgoing personality and to adapt to new environments easily 
	I love attending the Whitechapel youth group, where I created a book to be sold in the London Art book fair. This allowed me to develop my writing skills and my team working skills helped to create and develop the final design for the book. My sales and marketing skills were also used as the book was sold out! 
	I planned and created an exhibition for the gallery which was called De/Construct. This allowed me to meet people with extraordinary skills and helped me to develop and put together an idea easily as well as take responsibility .</p>
